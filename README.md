# Repository for public datasets and scripts

## Who we are

The [Research Laboratory for Communication, Political Cultures and Economies of Collaboration (coLAB)](http://colab.uff.br), hosted by Fluminense Federal University (UFF), develops research aimed at understanding the interfaces between communication technologies and political cultures, with special emphasis on phenomena related to repertoires of digital activism, rhetorical and discursive strategies of actors in the formal field of politics, dynamics of sociability and political literacy, political economy of information and circulation of disinformation and hate speech. Associated to the Brazilian National Institute of Science and Technology in Digital Democracy (INCT.DD), the group brings together researchers dedicated to the area of political communication, at different education degrees. Research lines include studies on: communication strategies and public opinion, political cultures and collective action, and humor and political discussion.

coLAB houses different projects. Some of the projects that provide public datasets and materials for this repository are:

* **#MUSEUdeMEMES** (#MEMEmuseum): [#MUSEUdeMEMES](http://museudememes.com.br) is a project focused on researching and cataloguing the universe of Brazilian internet memes.

* **DDoS Lab**: The Laboratory to Combat Disinformation and Hate Speech in Network Communication Systems (DDoS Lab) develops a continuous and regular monitoring on the activity of extremist far-right networks on WhatsApp and other online social platforms.

* **Observatório de Tretas** (Observatory of Political Tretas): "Treta" is a Brazilian slang to flamed discussion or public controversy. The Observatory of Political Tretas is a project in partnership with Rodrigo Carreiro (UFBA) and the Brazilian National Institute of Science and Technology in Digital Democracy (INCT.DD). Its main goal is to develop a methodology for systematic monitoring of online political discussions, especially in Twitter and Facebook environments.

* **Cooperation Games**: The Cooperation Games project was developed between 2012 and 2017 and generated a box of para-educational games involving dilemmas of cooperative action, such as the renowned Prisoner Dilemma. In 2015, the project was awarded the CNPq Highlight for Scientific and Technological Initiation award.

In addition to these projects, the repositories provide data from a series of other coLAB researchers' initiatives.

## What is this repository for

The purpose of this repository is to store and make publicly available research data and materials used in scientific and technological products by members of the Research Laboratory for Communication, Political Cultures and Economies of Collaboration (coLAB).

## What materials are publicly available

The public repository for *datasets* and *scripts* of the coLAB research group is a GitHub set of repositories that brings together different databases and applications used by researchers associated with the group. The data are made available in an open way to any interested parties. Repositories may host:

* **Databases** used in research developed by members of the group. The data available are collected in several ways and, in all cases, respect users privacy. No private data is shared by this repository. Formats may vary between comma separated values (CSV), spreadsheets (XLS) and others more specific (Atlas.TI, NVivo, RProj etc.). Some repositories also offer contingency tables generated from the original databases.

* **Datasets** and **Filesets** publicly available may present previously selected *corpora* used in researches developed by group members. Files may be in several formats, such as JPEG, GIF, MP4 and others. The data selection criteria are presented in the documentation of each repository and/or in the article or thesis that originates it.

* **Codebooks**, that is, supplementary research materials that indicate interpretation procedures and qualitative content analysis methods. Codebooks are guides to coders training for categorical data processing.

* **Scripts**, or programs written to automate a set of procedures during the exploratory data analysis stage. The scripts presented in this repository treat and model data previously used in researches developed by group members.

* **Documentation**: simple documents informing about procedures adopted in several research stages.

Other datasets and materials that eventually contain private data are not included in public repositories.

Articles, papers published in scientific journals or in conference proceedings, theses and dissertations, book chapters, and other written products can be retrieved from our [**coLAB Figshare repository**](https://figshare.com/projects/Papers_coLAB/35102).

## How do one accesses data
